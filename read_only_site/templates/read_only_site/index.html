<h2>Welcome to the Hard Drop League!</h2>

<img src="{% static 'read_only_site/img/hard_drop_logo.png' %}">

<h3>How do I register?</h3>
Go to the Hard Drop Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/harddrop">
https://discord.gg/harddrop</a>),
and type <kbd>!register [jstris handle]</kbd> in the #compete channel.

<br><br>

<h3>How do I submit my score?</h3>
The loser of the match has to type
<kbd>!winner @mention</kbd>,
with @mention mentionning the winner.

<br><br>

<h3>What kind of matches can I play?</h3>
It's up to you! As long as you play jstris
(<a href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/">https://jstris.jezevec10.com/</a>)
 and agree with the other player what kind of format you want to play, it's fine!
The base format should be first to 7.

<br><br>

<h3>What is the ranking?</h3>
The ranking is a number determining your rank.
The higher the better! You win ranking points by winning matches, and lose ranking
points by losing matches.

A highly ranked player will lose a lot of points if they lose against a lower ranked
player; but a low ranked player will win a lot of points if they win against a
highly ranked player!

The more matches you do, the more your ranking will match your actual rank.

<br><br>
